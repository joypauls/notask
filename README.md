# scry :crystal_ball:

A terminal-based file system explorer written in Go intuitive and snappy enough to keep up with your thoughts! Intended to exist in the space somewhere between the `ls` utility and a full-featured GUI file manager like Ranger to make some common tasks easy, quick, and fun.

This project makes heavy use of the wonderful [tcell](https://github.com/gdamore/tcell) Go package.
